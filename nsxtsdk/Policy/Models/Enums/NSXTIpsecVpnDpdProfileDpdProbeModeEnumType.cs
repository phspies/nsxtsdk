    /// DPD probe mode is used to query the liveliness of the peer. Two modesare possible:- PERIODIC: is used to query the liveliness of the peer at regularintervals (dpd_probe_interval). It does not take into considerationtraffic coming from the peer.The benefit of this mode over the on-demand mode is earlier detection ofdead peers. However, use of periodic DPD incurs extra overhead. Whencommunicating to large numbers of peers, please consider using on-demandDPD instead.- ON_DEMAND: is used to query the liveliness of the peer by instructingthe local endpoint to send DPD message to a peer if there is traffic tosend to the peer AND the peer was idle for dpd_probe_interval seconds(i.e. there was no traffic from the peer for dpd_probe_interval seconds).
