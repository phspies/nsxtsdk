Please add these to your    LDAP server configuration.BIND_DN_INVALID: The bind DN or username provided is not valid    on the LDAP server. Check that the bind DN is correct.    This error may also indicate that the base DN in your    configuration is incorrect.CERTIFICATE_HOSTNAME_MISMATCH_ERROR: The hostname configured for    the LDAP server does not match the hostname in the server&apos;s    certificate subject or alternative subject names. Be sure    that the hostname you configure in NSX Manager matches one    of those names.CERTIFICATE_MISMATCH_ERROR: The certificate presented by the    LDAP server did not match the certificate in the configuration    on the NSX Manager.CONNECTION_REFUSED: The connection was refused when contacting the    LDAP server. Ensure that the LDAP server is running and that    you are using the correct ip/hostname.CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: The connection timed out when contacting    the LDAP server. Check the hostname/ip and any firewalls    between the NSX Manager and the LDAP server.GENERAL_ERROR: An undetermined error occurred.INVALID_CONFIGURED_CERTIFICATE: The certificate configured for    this LDAP server is invalid and could not be decoded. Check    that the PEM-formatted certificate you provided is correct.INVALID_CREDENTIALS: The username and/or password are incorrect.SSL_HANDSHAKE_ERROR: An error occurred while establishing a secure    connection with the LDAP server. Check that the LDAP server&apos;s    certificate is correct, and that it is using an SSL/TLS    cipher suite that is compatible with the NSX Manager.    This error can also occur if the hostname you have configured    for the LDAP server does not match any of the hostnames in    the Subject Alternative Name records in the server    certificate.STARTTLS_FAILED: Unable to use StartTLS to upgrade the connection    to use TLS. Ensure that the LDAP server supports TLS and if    not, use LDAP or LDAPS as the protocol.UNKNOWN_HOST: The hostname of the LDAP server could not be    resolved.NO_ROUTE_TO_HOST: There is no network route to the host.BIND_EXCEPTION: A socket to the remote host could not be opened.PORT_UNREACHABLE: The LDAP port is not open on the remote host.BASE_DN_NOT_WITHIN_DOMAIN: For Active Directory, the base DN    is not a subtree of the Domain Component tree corresponding    to the LDAP domain. For example, if the domain is    &quot;example.com&quot;, the baseDN should be &quot;dc=example, dc=com&quot;    or a subtree like &quot;ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com&quot;.LDAP_SERVER_DISABLED: The LDAP server is marked as disabled    in the NSX configuration and will not be used.
