    /// Load Balancing algorithm chooses a server for each new connection by goingthrough the list of servers in the pool. Currently, following load balancingalgorithms are supported with ROUND_ROBIN as the default.ROUND_ROBIN means that a server is selected in a round-robin fashion. Theweight would be ignored even if it is configured.WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN means that a server is selected in a weightedround-robin fashion. Default weight of 1 is used if weight is not configured.LEAST_CONNECTION means that a server is selected when it has the leastnumber of connections. The weight would be ignored even if it is configured.Slow start would be enabled by default.WEIGHTED_LEAST_CONNECTION means that a server is selected in a weightedleast connection fashion. Default weight of 1 is used if weight is notconfigured. Slow start would be enabled by default.IP_HASH means that consistent hash is performed on the source IP address ofthe incoming connection. This ensures that the same client IP address willalways reach the same server as long as no server goes down or up. It maybe used on the Internet to provide a best-effort stickiness to clientswhich refuse session cookies.
