It does not take into considerationtraffic coming from the peer. The benefit of this mode over theon-demand mode is earlier detection of dead peers.However, use of periodic DPD incurs extra overhead. Whencommunicating to large numbers of peers, please consider using on-demand DPD instead.ON_DEMAND - is used to query the liveliness of the peer byinstructing the local endpoint to send DPD message to a peer ifthere is traffic to send to the peer AND the peer was idle fordpd_probe_interval seconds (i.e. there was no traffic from thepeer for dpd_probe_interval seconds)
