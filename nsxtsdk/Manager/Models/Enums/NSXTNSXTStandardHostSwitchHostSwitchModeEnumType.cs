This mode provides accelerated networking performances but also introduces additional prerequisites. In order to benefit from this mode, workloads will be need to be compiled with DPDK and will use VMXNET3 for their vNIC. This mode is only available on ESX hypervisor (6.7 and above, recommended 6.7 U2 and above) and unavailable on KVM, EDGE and Public Cloud Gateway. Not all NSX features are available in this mode, please consult the documentation. ENS_INTERRUPT - This is an interrupt driven variant of the Enhanced Data Path mode. Please, consult your account representative for applicability. This mode is available only on ESX hypervisor (7.0 and above).If this property is specified, transport_zone_endpoints must be specified at StandardHostSwitch level.
