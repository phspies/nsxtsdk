To configure NSX on such hosts, you can use this VDS as a HostSwitch from NSX manager. vCenter has the ownership of MTU, LAG, NIOC and LLDP configuration of such VDS backed HostSwitch. Remaining configuration (e.g. UplinkHostswitchProfile) will be managed by NSX.NVDS represents NSX Virtual Switch which is NSX native HostSwitch. All configurations of NVDS will be managed by NSX. HostSwitch of type NVDS has been deprecated on ESX hosts that are managed by a vCenter Server.
